# The Ethernaut
Welcome to my solutions for The Ethernaut, a Web3/Solidity based wargame played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. You can find the challenge [here](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/).

The Ethernaut is a series of challenges that test your understanding of smart contract security. Each level presents a unique contract with a specific vulnerability or weakness where it is up to you to find and exploit it.

These Jupyter notebooks describe my solutions for each level of The Ethernaut. I hope you find my code helpful! ðŸ˜„
